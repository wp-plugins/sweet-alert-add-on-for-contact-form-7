This plugin adds the Sweet Alert script into Contact Form 7 wordpress plugin submission process.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the [Sweet Alert script](http://tristanedwards.me/sweetalert) into [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) wordpress plugin submission process.

Just activate it to replace CF7 default submission output by a Sweet Alert pop up.
The add-on will display the Contact Form 7 messages in the pop up.

== How does it work? ==

It enqueues scripts and styles to override CF7 submission process and surcharge it with Sweet Alert scripts.

== Installation ==

You can install automatically from WordPress.

Or, if you want to install manually, follow these steps:

1. Upload the entire 'sweet-alert-for-cf7' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress admin.

* There is no "control panel" for this plugin. You customize pop up messages within the original CF7 messages fields
